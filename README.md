# TIOW-ACE-Compatability-Mod
This is the base code for our ACE Compatability mod

HOW THIS MOD WORKS

This mod works by applying modified hitpoint values of a SM to bring them more in line with ACE caculations. This means that marines will now be effected by both ACE based damage and medical conditions.

To create your own mod, you will need the BI tools. Which a tutorial for installing them can be found here.
